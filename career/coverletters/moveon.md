Hello,

I found this job posting *incredibly* timely. Firstly, on my end, I need to relocate to a different part of the country, so a remote job that is temporary is a perfect fit for my needs right now. Secondly, I am very concerned about the state of our current administration. These last three years have been an absolute embarrassment. Working on this problem is critical, so I'd be excited to have the opportunity to do so. Below are some details about my background, skills, and a slight snapshot as to who I am as a developer.

- Most of my experience revolves around building fast and reliable systems using C++. I've worked in the safety critical domain of autonomous vehicles as well as the performance critical domain of rapid data processing.

- All of the projects that I've worked on had some kind of front-end interface. I've needed to do front-end work to make the products usable, though I have not done much user experience focused work. That has usually been left to someone with an expertise in that domain, where I was called on to implement their designs.

- I'm adept at working in Unix-like environments, be it macOS or a Linux distribution. I prefer to use command-line programs and use Emacs as my main text-editor. I began learning in IDEs, so if the workflow between developers is based on an IDE, then that's just as good, too. I haven't worked too much in the Windows environment as a development platform, though I am definitely willing to put the time into learning it.

- I enjoy using test-driven development as a technique for facilitating stability in a platform.

- I am well-versed in the Atlassian suite of tools for the Agile development paradigm and Github's review and merging systems as a tool outside of Git itself.

- I love to learn new technologies. I come from an electrical engineering background, so the precision, depth, and speed that C++ offers is very fun to me. Like most things, though, there are drawbacks, and like all solutions, there is room for trade-offs. Anything that helps get the job done is useful, and I love to learn about all the different inventions to do that in any domain.

The upcoming election will decide how the United States moves into this next decade, setting us up for how we will fare over the next 50 years. We need to get this right. If you have any questions, please contact me.

Sincerely,

Borja Rojo Ilvento
