Are there classes required?
How many positions are there?
Is it possible to make your own projects?
What is expected of leaders and how would you show that skillset when you are not?

Are there places to learn new skills? I've always been interested in wood and metal working. I've recently gotten interested in sewing and fashion.

Projects:
Team based? Subject based? Structure? Ability to move inbetween? Ability to move to different campuses for different project types?
Ask about Robotics and what it would take to be able to work on those kinds of projects.

Culture:
Work-
- Remote work. Is it common, by person, discouraged?
- Is there a typical day schedule? Maybe by team? Like meetings happen mostly at X time and individual time usually happens at another?
- Hobby groups? I'm into music, video games, and anime. Although that's what I know well, I'd like to try new things as well. Is there a forum around that kind of stuff?

Infrastructure:
- Code base accessibility
- Allowing others to edit each other's code.
- Accountability, as in are you always responsible for all the code you've written.
- Documentation, must it be extensive? Should I expect well documented code?

HR:
If you have a problem with someone's attitude, what are the expected actions? Is direct confrontation as a first step apropriate, or should you go an talk to a supervisor first?
