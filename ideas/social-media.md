### Reputation

Give tools to the users to be able to vouch for each other to emulate the way the humans give authority to each other.

Remember Rei's comments: It's important to realize that people are not pieces of data. When you try to box them, you loose a lot.
Response to that: Don't try to  box people, then. Try and give them as many tools as possible to have as high a resolution of themselves presented. Considering that social media tends to be all about data representation, it is very important to allow people to see the information about who vouches for who in order to communicate someone's legitimacy.

With similar theming to the Profile app, someone's profile and 'credentials' could be set to be viewable as they see fit, either globally, personally, or per post. Maybe, for each endorsement they have, they can set what kind of information is viewable by someone who is observing their profile in a specific lens.

Take, for example, a professor. He may be part of a university, a published author, and part of a certain political Party. If the professor then has a set of information about himself that he can display to others in concert with an endorsement from the university, and a different set for him publisher. He may even want to keep the fact that he is part of a certain political party separate from his more public profile as to not feel as though he is speaking for the party while he converses about chemistry. This would allow one user to be able to adopt different persona depending on the situation.

Some may argue this is deceitful in nature. Intuitively, that is understandable, but I would disagree with that in practice.

Because the contribution of a person using the app is valued in what they say, not who they are, then being a republican talking about chemistry shouldn't nullify his argument about chemistry. This system allows people to be able to control what 'credentials' they think are important in allowing others to trust them more. 

There is also the argument of conflict of interest to think about. I believe this is related to the previous idea, but is also not applicable.

Someone should be able to argue two sides of the same argument and be able to show that they know what they are talking about for both sides.

Something that should considered for this is if someone should be able to post as two different people under one argument. That must be further explored. Also, something to further explore might be someone's ability to post as different people across different arguments as to avoid doxing as well as argue different sides in different arguments.

With that being said, if you can set yourself up as someone different for different arguments, then you should be able to use different handles for different arguments. I believe this will contribute to the ability for arguments to be held intellectually on the content posted as well as isolated away from identity as much as possible.

To keep in line with having users have as much power as possible, it could make sense to allow those who endorse you to condition the usage of their endorsement. For example, maybe a certain organization wants to give an individual their endorsement. In order for that to happen, the organization can request that the user show them who they are as well as require that the user display certain information about themselves while using the endorsement.

Although this may come from an ideological lens, these endorsements mean that someone represents the group who is endorsing them. In order for this concept to persist, the endorsers must be able to define in what situations a person is allowed to use an endorsement. Therefore an endorser must have the power to require a user to act a certain way under their umbrella. Of course, this dynamic allows for an abuse of power on the end of the endorser, by rigidly defining what is allowed to be said and what is not. That being said, though, a situation can also be created where someone is able to say what they want on the behalf of the endorser who theoretically trusts the endorsed person's judgement. It can go both ways and any amount in between, but what this ensures is that everyone gets what they deserve. 

Note: This is a dynamic where the website should be built to facilitate the later situation. Although the functionality opens up the door to many possibilities, there should be a way to indicate how much is being said from a speaker that is their own words.

### Communication Types and Personas

There are many ways to communicate in general, with audio, video, photo, and text. So far, each has been available through different formats which each give their own utility, there there is seems to be little cohesion between them all.
Email: formal, more permanent, subject and group oriented
Text/IM: less formal, less permanent, context oriented. fleeting in nature
Feeds: formal, fleeting
Profiles (facebook, insta): formal, permanent

Each one has it's own advantages and disadvantages but tend to pose walls around each other's interfaces. Each one interacts different to lend to the the nature of the system. A post is formal feeling because you are posting to the world, but has the same quick and simple utility as a text, as well as the same scrolling mechanism that disapears after a day. Email is more permanent feeling because the messages stay until they are moved, which lends to the task/subject oriented nature of them. 

one is temporary unless otherwise looked for, the other is permanent unless otherwise erased.

Due to this, how our users interact with new media must also be evaluated and trimmed. A goal to keep, though, is a type of universality between each medium, where the different contexts that a post is being made to must be served in a different light. That being said, much can be achieved though a more unified posting interface.

So, an idea to try and aspire to is making a message the same way for any kind of post, where options are given correspondingly for personalization. Then, a post can be made to a context, say a chat group displayed in classic format (or something else), or to the world and sent out for others to see in classic feed format (or something else).

Many consumption mediums, for different contexts and utilities, driving the different ways that people can interact with each other on a communications app.

### New Tag for Products

Tags are used all the time in social media to both reference people and to apply attributes to a message. Tags to people could be applied to objects as well to be able to reference them. This would be useful in many ways. For a company, it could allow them to be able to make official marketing campaigns on social media. People talking about the product could also interact with the product through this as well.

What could be cool with this then is to begin to do direct correlation between different tags to amplify thier experience. Undrestanding what topics people are interested in more accurately is good data, and having real achors to products, movies, music, or anything could be a good way to do that.

In a distributed scheme, this could be achieved by having a host build an API that can allow you to fetch the information about that object. That tag could hold other meta information too, which could be cool to have for people to be able to reference immediately.

### Higher Interactivity

Remember Collage App

Pictures:
Mark objects in picture to have notes or connected extra media like sound

EX: If at a restaurant and you take a picture of your food, you can highlight, select (some identification function) of the food or drink and clip a set of information to it. Think, contextual and advanced tags. In the photo, you can then tap the object in the photo and mark it with the name of th food, which may have the ingredients or even the recipe. If at a restaurant, assuming collaboration, the restaurant itself could provide this kind of information to you. This could be done automatically assuming that the app recognizes your location and activity and makes this information available to you easily.

That information could almost be like a local "clipboard", in that its ready to go and easily selectable.
ADVANCED: with enough pictures, a program could learn what the dishes at a restaurant look like and will be able to identify and tag the items for you.

Cascading deeper, you could get even more information. So you have the ingredients of the dish, which come from somewhere. The restaurant could provide the information/links to websites of the places of where it gets it's ingredients. So you are at a vegetarian place, you order so eggplant Parmesan, you take a picture of it, and the cheese that is being used that day is marked and tracked specifically to a certain farm or cheese house in Parma Italy.

Now, from this picture of the food on your plate, you're reading and learning about what it took to make that dish from start to finish.

Connectivity to the Web:
So sure you can have information that is provided contextually, but if you are trying to make your own media, separate from the active stuff, then you would also need to be able to search the web and link information that is relevent on your own terms (Ie, it's not provided for you). If I took a picture of my desk and started tagging stuff in the picture, I could also then link information of my monitor to and Amazon purchase link, a wiki article on ultra-wide monitors, and a link to the /r/ultrawidemasterrace subreddit.

Again, maybe this service can be paid in many different ways. It could be paid using crypto. It could also be paid by allowing those who process your data to keep it and then sell it off. Maybe this sort of contextually agnostic usage of the social media can be something that our company processes and accesses ourselves and allows us to keep the data.

So because they service they are using is something that we are providing, we have the ability to keep the data. Seperately, if the people use the app in a way that is run and processed by a venues machine and lives in their space, then the venue can keep the data. Conversely, we could use that data for our own circle of social media and the venue for their own.

Self investment/ making something your own:
One of, if not the critical point, of social media is the ability to interact with it yourself as yourself, with other people. The news, for example, tends to be enticing to watch because it is about events that are a part of the human world, and as humans are social and empathetic creatures, we project and care about the things that happen. Therefore, when stories are created that reflect the outside world, we are enticed to consume it. There is something obviously inherent about that, because many times the stories we listen to are about people and places that have nothing to do with our own contextual world, and yet we feel connected to it (even if that feel may not be accurate at all).

This feeling has been shown to be even more powerful and enticing with the advent of social media. Having the ability to interact with someone elses life, or other people's lives as a whole, is something that attracts people. Whether that is being a political activist on the Facebook news feed or just being a voice of comfort for people going through a tough situation, maybe one similar to yours, people have shown they want to be able to connect.

So connecting. That's the key. Now, I'm going to elaborate on what connecting really is and what it can be at a fundamental level.

Thing of any social media post. Most of them, you can comment on them in some way shape or form. That is a connection. Think of retweeting or sharing a post. That is a connection. Think of responding back to a snap chat. That is a connection.

A connection would be any instance where you are able to link/ leave your mark/ alter/ invest yourself/ be involved someone elses effort with your own influence. That's a abtracted and general maybe not totally accurate, but i think the idea itself is pretty powerful.

You can make a mark by linking your own piece of creation on another. Thats a text response. That's a photo.

You could even make a mark by changing someone else's creation. That's like that time when reddit had the pixel wars, where you could change a pixel every hour on one photo.

Community created content is the driving factor behind social media. Current social media paradigms, though, are usually create and observe, where observation can be vocalized. With this new way of thinking, that can change. Someone could create a piece of content for a specific purpose and parametrize what are the aspects of if that can be linked and modified and marked against. For example:

Someone creates a playlist. In fact, when they create it, it ahs a theme and and some character and a description, but not much else. Not even the music or videos that will be contained in the playlist. The playlist is a playlist in concept only, with as much filling out done by the creator as they want.

The playlist could be left like that, but that would be silly, naturally. What if, instead, they had the ability to plan for that and used the idea that others could modify the playlist to their advantage. In fact, the playlist that was created was actually meant to be commnity populated. So maybe the poster said, "This is an early 90's music playlist, any genre. 50 songs max. Songs can be suggested and and voted on, an d the top 50 requests will be what shows up." So they make this and people iteract with it and the playlist gets populated accordingly. Maybe the songs themselves are decided on by the poll and the website will use that information to lookup the songs in it's database and autolink the song data from the database.

You could also, if you want, have the data be searched and filled automatically from the website itself, which could hold data of song medias throughout the site and be able to make decisions on how to populate the playlist.

Maybe this playlist is not meant to be for everyone to comment on. Maybe you don't want the plebs to voice their opinion. Then, you also mark what kind of people can interact with it and instead get a biased playlist creation (and that might not be bad if you want it geared from or towards, or gear from to another, kind of audience). 

That in and of itself could upset people because it could restrict interaction. Instead, if could be better to have it such that everyone can vote on it this playlist and what is DEFAULT rendered is through a filtered set of data. And then, each person who views the playlist could then filter what kind of people they want to have takend suggestions from for the playlist, then rendering their own playlist under their own bias. 

Remember what Elon Musk said about limbic resonance in social media:

Specifically he said that social media gets you to use it more and more because it resonates with how humans think more than other form of media. (Personally, I think it can sometimes be a self fulfilling prophecy, in that the media has gotten our brain to be able to process it very well, so they begin to go in sync more and more.) I still think that it is not completely natural. It doesn't yet feel like it guides you through experiences in a way that you do not need to think about. There still requires some interpretation.

What must be recognized of course is the difference between the ability for something to display what you want in a way that it more natural to how humans interpret something and what exactly is being interpreted. Those are two different things.

If a program has the ability to analyze an image and throw up an overlay on the image that marks different features, that is an example of the program being able to distinguish stuff in the image. That is one side to it.

The other side is the program choosing what to filter out and overlay for you. That is something else, though it is relevant and just as important. The distinction should be made such that a program can probably analyze more features that we can recognize ourselves, and that it would be comfortable to view something that points out what we can recognize in a way that makes it easier for us to recognize it. Like, basically, a program could overlay a filter to reduce the amount processing we need to do to understand a scene.

It could overlay on every feature or just some, and doing one vs the other has different implications on how the program must interpret a users perception.By that, I mean in order to maximize resonance, the program must be able to time overlays to how a person analyzes naturally. This means that, indeed, user interfaces would bend to look differently to different people, but humans all have certain similarities in how we perceive, so reflecting that would maximize resonance.

This also implies that a program would need to be able to analyze a scene faster than a human.

This also means that a program must be able to analyze, at least, all things that a human, anyone not just one person, can analyze and pull out all the information that human might be able to analyze from a scene. And also be able to display it for human intuition.

This also then means that a program that can do this is effectively as informed and has the analytical powers of all humans. Most likely, this would mean this kind of program would be able to surpass that, as to be able to assuredly contain that subset of human knowledge as well as understanding of perceptive tendencies.


### Modularization

The app can be built very modularly.

Take a look at discord. It has the ability to link to tons of different places and pull information to then intelligently know a ton of information. This allows users of both services to have INTEGRATED tooling, effectively making discord both an extension of other apps as well as its own platform entirely.

Think this way for this app. If any sort of place has a section for a discussion forum, comments, or anything, then this discussion app should be available to take over that section and then also be able to provide all the other kinds of features that the app has that a normal comment section does not. Furthermore, now that this app would be embedded in other places (like discord has for it's web modules) this app should also have the ability to pull information from those other platforms to be used in the main app.

It's like looking at one thing from two different lenses, but the app should be made so that you want to use the app instead ;)

Another point to look at is compartmentaizing and decoupling many of the different aspects of the app. A simple way to think about this is function bundling agnostic to data (think funcitonal programing). If a response is composed of a piece of displayed media in a certain way, the response should manifest itself by organizing the media and display type together and guarantee that all "responses" have certain properties. You could then swap out different display methods and change the look of a response. Even, you could have a "content display" function that takes content and a display method, like "Respondable post" that then takes the data and organizes it while adding the ability to respond to it. "Respondable post" could contain a "media display" and "response prompt" together, which would make it up, and then you could swap out "media display" for a "video" or "text" (display), whic the response prompt could be then be something that is interactable. That "response prompt" could then be interactable with by static media, " a non respondable post" or even another whole "respondable post", of which could then itself be rendered as a preview in the current post and links to a whole other page.

That last example was pretty basic, to be honest. This can be highly expanded further. Imagine a post that represents a survey. There are many ways to break down a survey. There is a title, then responses, then the way to display it, then the way to keep track of the answers, then the way to interact with the survey, etc. Each of those elements could be broken down even further, to then be able to hold references to many different things. You could even see who answered what, if you'd like, and go further into deciding what it is that you've decided. We can even take it a step further.

A survey like this, which tracks who answered what, then has answers tied to people, who each have their own characteristics. You could then run data analysis on those people from those answers. and see what kinds of people voted what. You could make graphs for people to consume, maybe even data captures of graphs over time and see if they change if people are allowed to vote multiple times.

I just had another cool idea, which honestly although it may kind of tie into this, is sort of separates but still enjoys the same mechanics presented earlier. That, in itself, is kind of the point of this exercise.

Thinking about the previously proposed properties, ie the ability to tie different representations of media as well as interactive functionality together into larger, singular media entities, you could use these properties to create highly integrated music play lists with tons of different properties. So:

Imagine someone made a post that is of type "Playlist". It self contains a list of "Songs", as well as some other kind of funtionality like the ability for people to comment on the playlist as a whole, or maybe even have people be able to vote on songs to include in such a playlist, or really anything else that comes to mind. Each song itself could be pulled from a number of different places, such as youtube, spotify, soundcloud, etc. Because each of these sources feeds an audio file, you can use an adapter and present them in a uniform manner. A source like Youtube for example could even provide a video feed (and even only if the client wanted, as in maybe they could auto toggle off all music videos for a music playlist). Each song could also itself be voted on to determine it's source, which could mean that someone could put together a skeleton playlist of songs that they want and other could fill out where they come from.

The playlist paradigm could be abstracted further to be such that it is a list of media that is playable in sequence, which means this instance may be used for music, a mix of video and audio. A playlist could also have an auto or custom transition announcer that give you information about each media instance as it begins to play, or in between, or even as a latched part of the "Song" instance set by the playlist creator, which someone else can then take and link somewhere else in a different playlist. You could even make a playlist that conglomerates for different specific instances of media from many other playlists, each media piece being a singular instance of playable media.

Each song could have, apart from a connection to a playable source, a conglomerate or other details that you could explore as well, from the playlist. It has already been said that the playlist is an organizational display format with autoplah functionality, but what it displays and knows about is coming from a collection of songs, each of which is way thicker in information. That information is connected to that song, and although said information is not currently front facing in a playlist format, it should still be easily discoverable.

*Remember, the internet is about what how you display information. If you display basic song info and play controls, with the rest hidden, it will not be easily visible. That can be good for compactness in context, but it should also be noted that if you want to have people to be able to intuitively explore that richer set of information, an indicator/some sort of intuitive interfacing should be available as well, with the front facing playlist. That being said, there needs to be caution in striking the right balance (though anything that is out of the way but still visible would be a decent naive solution).

There is so much you can do.

Expanding ahead past the media units themselves.

Website interaction can be modular as well. There are many of the currents models of media catagorizing, such as sub reddits which is media by topic (though also heavily community and culture biased), there are Facebook groups which is people oriented (which biases toward topic and use), there are filters for hot, new, different time constraints, etc.

This can be modularized to hell and back. As much as they are presented differently, they are all feeds, each with their own content type. It is possible to create your own feed that filters by content type.

A feed that is one tech articles and papers, of which are only of the last week, so it's the latest developments in tech. A feed that is playlists of music that is only of songs older than x date. A feed that is only pictures of kittens. A feed that is about anything as long as the word 'cake' is present. Then, you could set them up and have then be available to be pulled and refreshed when you want.

You could have these feeds as tab, mixed into a master list with different weights of each  feed, etc.

Some more UI stuff:
Think back to Kamo and the cards and the navigation and the worlds and the linking and the colors of boarders to indicate different things about the media and the reward system.

The different personas idea can allow people to be able to participate in different areas allowing them to be able to wear different earned skins / stuff that will show off what they've done/ accomplished in different communities. Instead of just badges, which are dinky little icon representations of something, get a piece of clothing for your avatar that is way more swag and expressive. Reward systes for participating in different kinds of discussions and people endorsing you for your contributions. 

Imagine if these points gained from participation were kept in a blockchain and were exchangable like a crypto currency. That could be an interesting interface between the app and reality, again tying back into people being able to make cool media in different communities, like maybe a category (or something) run by a restaurant, and then be rewarded for it later if their content is good. They could even get endorsements from the restaurant and your persona could have a hat or something from that restaurant showing loyalty, authority, and advertisement.

Engagement Form:
The website, as a platform that allows you to create and organize media, as well as connect and traverse it, definitely would benefit from a social side to it. That being said, the social part of it would help support it flourish as well as access the interface to the context of the social activity of humans. The social aspect is a tool, but not EXACTLY the main point. 

The point is the content, and the connections made in between the content, which are all made by people. THAT'S what makes everything important.

I would therefore say that each piece of content, as well as sub portions of a content, must be consumable on their own. Rather, the website should allow and edge the media creator to allow their posts to be consumable as a unit. Therefore when someone else comes along, the page can be seen as the context of itself. If the post is singularly a sub portion of another post, like a direct response, this would mean the sub portion viewed on its own would be part of a larger context. Sub portions themselves might be interesting to view in isolation, though care should be taken in the navigation of the website to allow people to be able to traverse up to the primary contexts of a post.

In creating a post that is of some other context, it would be good to easily allow people to do that. Intuitively, it would make sense to allow someone to make a post like this after reading an article or when viewing the parent context page, then initialize the creation of a response page from there. Maybe highlighting a part of a passage in part of post or something, and then have a link.

Point is, encourage viewing on context singularly coming in from anywhere.

### Newsfeed +1

Current news feed algorithms seem to be focused more on the idea of analyzing and classifying media to then be able to reserve it to users in a way to achieve some arbitrary goal.

The problem that I have with them is that the goal is generally to increase site time, or to get you to buy products, or to push an agenda.

The concept has some merit to it in that there is a system that is able to classify media automatically. That is powerful in itself, obviously. That way that is used, though, can be more intelligent. A newsfeed with certain goals may inherently then become asymptotic to content type and narrow in to specific content types if goal and the user align for that to happen. Even if that may not be the point, it may be a side effect due to the nature of humans. By this, I mean people are inclined to continue to spend more time on certain specific subjects. It may be different for everyone, but once the algorithm detects what has you spend more time on the site than other things, ti will try and hone in on those things.

Also, depending on how it's tuned, it may incorrectly tune the content, as showing you less and less content self-restricts the ability for the algorithm to be able to sample for the most effective content type. It may be smart enough to correct, or it may not be. There are ways to correct, but it would require an algorithm that wants to test new kinds of content (or content that is slightly different, as will be explained below).

Problematically, though, this means that news feeds actually don't end up showing you anything new. It just means that they will show you content that resembles each other. This is where the idea of newfeed + 1 comes in

Newfeed + 1, or should I say traditional newsfeed + 1, would be the kind of newfeed that trys to constant show slightly different kinds of content on purpose to try and expand the base of which a user consumes. An intelligent algorithm could do this by classifying data and comparing their differences, and with some arbitrary tuning or even an algorithm that detects how much 'different' a person likes to consume over a cetain period of time. (that needs to also be watched for example, because maybe something is shown too early to someone for them to like or appreciate it and that may be mistakenly classified as bad. That being said, of course, this kind of algorithm should naturally be agnostic to unliked content, it should really just track what is liked and then keep trying to expand. Like it was said before, an autotuned newfeed that is conservative will narrow itself, so a systematically liberal newsfeed is needed, and preferably one that offers new content to people at a rate taht is in their comfort zone)

Straight up though, concidering that human happiness tends to be rooted in progress, agnostic of a goal, this kind of newfeed may nicely feed (emulate if possible but that's basically not applicable digitally) novel experiences such that people will get much higher hits of dopeamine when using it. Think of that being one of the side effects of reddit's system. User generated content that is upvoted such that the best is sent to the top and evolves overtime with  he state of the world.
One of the problems with that is, or course, that the croud sourced content is mass voted meaning the best new stuff is highly mainstreamed. SPECIALLIZING a NOVEL expereince is key to this. 

Facebok specializes a non-novel experience. Reddit doesn't specialize a novel experience.

-------------------------------------

I think a way to do this would need to involve machine learning and AI together.

At a basic level, the problem is how to present media to people that they would like but also have elements that they have not yet seen. There are two evaluations for a viable media that fulfills that criteria, which is the result of two things.

The first the evaluation of what elements/characteristics a piece of media has. Determining that, be it how specific, perfecntage, what categories, blah blah blah, just classifing them well is it's own problem. But, once done, a media peice can be used to be a more catagorized, distilled state then it's whole original version. Realistically, that probably means that this kind of evaluation inherently looses information about the media. It must be considered whether or not that is the kind of thing that you want. Goal 1 is to evaluate the media, though how you do that must be concidered as that will impact what it is interpreted to inherently. The aim is to be as truthful as possible and eliminate as much bias as possible. I think, just because we would be judging something, this is inherently impossible. But that's kinda cool tbh, because that means you can strive for something that can't be perfected, and also allows you to try different things for different results.

The second goal is determining a second piece of media from the first to show. This I believe is inherently a search problem where the searching algorithm directly effects the results. So, search criteria and goal will yeild different results, meaning that the system of search is also important is presenting stuff to the user. A common criteria is to search for that which other people like that enjoy things that are similar to what you like. And concidering you only want to show the best of what people like, a couple things happen. First, a heirarchy in presentation is created among a community of similar people whose intersection manifests as your suggestions. That creates a system where a smaller and smaller subset of things are shown to you if you don't go out and find your own new media, or other people don't go out and find new media. The system of Newsfeed +1 needs to be designed to have a certain kind of criteria where the QUALITY of the solution found is the best of it's class, but the media is only VIABLE for the suggestions under certain criteria.

The Newsfeed problem is one of being in a certain place, which is your media experience, and trying to move to another place of media experience, via experiencing new media. How a system classifies the media you see and how it moves you from one to the next are the two elements that facilitate that progression. And, it is of utmost importance that the classification is as broad and unbiased as possible for the most truthful evaluation, as well as a crafting a search algorithm to find results with the desired relation to the previous media.


### Social Circle Watching

Being able to look at a group of people who interact with each other.

Vicarious living. Its really kinda sad but the dynamics, customs, and mindsets
that have been created with contemporary social media would definitely lend to
the success of something like this.

### Scalability

It is important to be able to apply scalibilty lenses to as many of the features as possible.

Media making is one of the features
Connection making is another
Media navigation is another

Each of these have their own propeties when it comes to how much would be feasable for someone to be able to consume easily. If someone makes a playlist that has indefinite size and free reign for people to add to it, there will be a storage and consumption problem. If a post blows up and have millions of connections, it would be very hard to be able to navigate through the best connections.

Keep in mind the null, 0, 1, multi states, and capping the flexibility and expand-ability of each feature appropriately.

### Creators vs Consumers

A system that is meant to provide 'new', in general, needs a source. This source is creative people. And, really, unless the platform is set up to be friendly for those who are creating, the whole thing will probably fail.

It needs to be easy to create new content. It should be easy for people to begin making content. It should be straightforward for people to learn how to make more complex content.

Good portals and studios that are intuitive are necessary. This will probably be difficult to produce.

High level media creation tools, such as automatic formatting, createable and resuaable templates, automatically updating content. automatically CREATED content, in a template, that auto updates, etc.

I want people on this website to be able to craft their media in ways that they want to.

People could also make shit media and it could be unintuitive to make good media
for someone who isn't as creative. There should be some tools to help people
build their skills, not just help those who have skills to plug themselves into
a new system and learn it quickly.

### Recommending People

This concept is super basic and common sense but many services don't abide by this logic. This allows them fabricate recommendations based on other people's experiences.

The truth here is that people are similar. The fallacy is that people are
different. And that previous statement is dubious, to say the least.

A system that may begin to blindly pair one person with a service or another person to accomplish a task would benefit from grouping two people together that synergize. But, if two people have a bad experience, it may be that they each are relatively bad at working with each other, not that they are each bad at working objectively.

This should be the framework for recommendations.

A pair of people might have differing opinions about each other. Aim to try and
pair together two people that will both have positive opinions about each other.

### User created custom advertising

Ads a decent way to make money as it is a form of communication about goods and services... as annoying as they might be. How to make them less annoying can be discussed in a different topic.

As there are influencers on instagram, and classical models and actors for comercials, there are people out ther who are willing to represent a product. The 'influencer' is a testament to the fact that there is a grass-roots potential in who is able to effectively advertise a product (or else companies wouldn't use them and influencers wouldn't exsist).

Therefore, I believe that there is potential if allowing any user to advertise products on their created content.

Now, I don't think that everyone is able to do it as good as others. That were the hosting company (me) comes in and helps grease the advertising gears, taking a cut along the way for our service. For those who can manage to advertise on their own due to their skill, that's great. But for those who are not as good to custom-combo a product placement, they can't take a piece of the pie. What our company can do is allow any user to place an ad on their page that we serve to them.

It would be prudent to allow the user who is placing the add to control what ads or what kinds of ads will show up with their content, but it would also be good if we could provide the service of suggesting what ads to place.

The service of providing ads can allow the company to take a cut, the user who serves the ads can also take a cut, and the company who wants ads placed takes a cut.

CRYPTO:
This transaction can be done with crypto with insentive on our end to privide the ability to discount or fully buy our products using crypto earned by displaying ads. I'm not sure if it would make sense to give user cash directly for displaying ads... as the kind of users a content creator atracts may not be the kind a brand wants to associate with. If the user wants direct cash, then maybe they would need to take to the companies who want their ads served directly. Otherwise they get crypto.

Then when they trade in crypto for our products, we have crypto to give.

The economics behind this would me users are insentivised to use products inside our ecosystem, until another company accepts our crypto currency. And once that happens, and the more that happens, the more our crypto becomes legitimate.
