### Greg's a Burnout Meme

Honestly gregs gonna be like 54 living his life. Forgetting about the time of
gluttony that he lived in roch. Living a classic suburban life with his
family. Then im gonna roll by in my tinted window sports car. Roll down the
window and let out a drunken Rusoff cackle and hit him and his entire family
with pickles in the face. As i speed off he tries to play it off like i was just
some crazy guy, but deep down it eats at him cause he knows he will never be
able to get me as good as I just got him

### Languages to Learn

Why:
Begin to read news, articles, and papers from around the world

What:
Languages that cover the most amount of people and influence. For example,
Japanese is only 125M people, but their tech and media is very influential.

China is huge in population and also very influential in work force.

French is very influential in academia and large around many African countries.

Spanish isn't exactly all that influential but it is very large and may become
very important in the future.

English is very influential and rather large, and is currently taught around the
world generally as the default second language.

### Subscriptions for Intellectual Content

There are a ton of resources that take intellect to create. Much of this is
evident in stuff like news and textbooks.

Currently, we have subscription models available for tons of different
entertainment, products, and news.

This website could leverage this phenomenon with a couple of ways to mitigate
those who want to use for free. Remember, teired payments system.

Of course, the obvious for free usage might be ads, of which how the ads are
done should be rethought and modernized. Other options for free usage should
also be explored.

Another thing you could do is offer the ability to subscribe to certain types of
outlets or all outlets for a specific price. Many news or educational outlets
already ask for subscription or one time fees for specific content.

This should , like everything else, be approached modularly, which high
flexibility and all that.

### Esports anime

Set during college time

Probably more American than Japanese, could be awesome that way

Candid, more DARK. Explore the more American culture side of things, drugs and
alcohol, parting, sex, etc.

High school friends play games with each other. Near end of highschool, they
have a falling out (maybe not). Each go off to separate colleges, start eSports
clubs. Compete in region league and stuff.

All star regional team playoffs?

All kinds of game genre?

Local, state, regional, national, international?

Opening: if it's following kids in college, the opening could be the typical
start of someone's day, with maybe slight changes depending on what's going on
in that episode. Like the intro uses the opening as a linking mechanism to the
episode, as a Segway. If the episodes are by week, or it starts with someone
always waking up and getting to practice day by day, the intro could be a recap
of what happened the last episode, the person falling asleep, and then waking
up, doing routine, and ending up at practice/where ever they need to be.

^^^ as a mechanism, a set of episodes or archs could start with this kind of
opening. Also, you could use this as a way to throw off the veiwer if maybe a
certain character is in a situation where they can't do their morning routine,
for some reason, and doesn't end up at practice. 

Full of memes, at least from games. In a group fight, maybe one person is left
on your team and the enemy says something like "you are at my mercy" and the
last guy says, "no, you are at ours. Heros never die!" And rez's the whole team
after building ult for the whole match or something. Better yet, enemy says "you
will die mercifully" and the Ally says "no u." And rezs the team. Even better,
at the beginning of the match, the enemy leader says "don't worry, I will show
you mercy" and the Ally support gets all pissed like "fucking who do does he
thing he is. 'ill show you mercy..." And builds for full Rez.
