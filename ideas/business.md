### Values

1. Don't sell out. Product over profit. Otherwise, the product will die.
2. Open systems. Modularize. Accessibility.
3. Perception is paramount. The way people see something is the way they understand it. Display what you want to communicate; don't assume inference.
4. People cannot be discretized. Anything that tries to will create a lower resolution representation. Assume there is information missing and try to get and represent as much valuable information as possible.

### Chord cognizant distortion pedal

See if multiplication allows for a note to have a unique energy signature

Check then if chords will give off a specific energy signature

See which chords have the same energy signatures

Chord density

    - see if there is a signature that dense chords can produce
    - is chord density important to the sound distortion creates
    - How dense of a chord can guitars reasonably produce anyways? They have strings that are decently distanced on the frequency scale.

Note count

    - does note number make a difference with distortion sound
    - not just chord density, but does adding a note above a current chord make a difference in how distortion effects sound?

Note frequency

    - this is obvious really, but how much does distortion matter against which note you are playing

Play style?

    - chug chords
    - arpegiation
      - combo of chord density and note count, but also decaying dynamic nature of density because notes rotate through
    - melodies
      - melodies are important because they might represent high density characteristics, and also show how the sound of the pedal effects quick transitions to close notes.

Dissonance amount

    - maybe there is a way to detect how harmonic something is. If there is dissonance already, it might not be a good idea to add much distortion on top of it.

### Custom Merchandising

Something that could be cool for a small brand with a big following is to capitalize on few whales by offering highly exclusive merchandise.

A type of merchandise taht could be cool is custom version of iconic items. For example, if would be pretty cool to make a custom branded Gameboy SP shell and sell it one or many modded with it. What could be cooler is to link that with something that you've created, so a playthrough for a GBA game then followed by a release of a custom SP would be pretty hype. Linking custom merchandise like that with iconic memories of your brand, like a souvenier from an event, could be pretty sick.

### Clothing line

Not sure where the audience might come from if it's really just a community thing, but these ideas could apply in many ways.

Beta-order

Preorder exclusivity along with using the preorder to gauge interest. If a new product is coming out, a type a beta can be done in order to gauge interest. Further detail can be aquiered by forcing users to fill out a server before the preorder. You can see what aspect of a product most intrigued people; price, design, community, exclusivity, etc. Then, for the pre-order, you can change something small that marks the facts that it was preorder and make that batch limited edition. For example, on a hoodie, you could change the color of the eyelets of the hood draws to some different color.

Shinys.

In an order, you can make a separate order with different color scheme of the same design in very limited quantities.

Clothing dispenser

Shop that is run very low maintenance, almost like a vending machine. Pick an item and it's comes out of a slot. Chance to get a shiny in-store this way.

#### Examples

	- A set of graphics that are geometric designs of typical legendary pokemon. I'm imagining a Ho-Oh design with lots of shard-like peices, almost like a stained glass window or mosaic, in bright colors against a white t-shirt
	- A shirt of Shinji Ikari in his Eva suit with the lyrics for "Boy, Become Legend" on it over a black background
	- A crossoveer series of designs with members of the company replacing characters in something with pop culture. I.E. a star wars movie poster-esque design with people swapped; King of the Hill gang of four with people swapped.
### Open Data Market

Market place to be able to list your data for sale, which can be automatically
accessed and downloaded for a price. The interaction would be automatically registered and on a blockchain.

### Digital Gambling Games

Not digital in the sense that they are classic gambling games emulated, but instead new gambling games that leverage digital properties which make them more interesting.

A gambling game that allows you to change up the likelihood of winning by
allowing you to choose different probability distributions. Harder distributions
pay out more.

### Drive Through and Delivered Groceries

Basic idea is that you drive up and get your stuff loaded into your car and you're on your way. There is the different approach of having everything delivered to you.

One of the big things that can be done with this system is waste reduction. Because things don't need to be parceled in such a way that they are good for the conventional grocery store, they can now be replaced with reusable containers. Packaging itself can be highly reduced if pre-portioning can be avoided by always buying by weight. This means that if you go to grab some cereal, there would be some container you use made of some glass or plastic that you'd give to a person or robot that would then go inside and fill the container for you from a bulk container of that cereal. This could also go for drinks, such as coke, beer, and water.

The grocery delivering can also be accomplished by doing an exchange of containers, where someone would bring you the reusable containers full of food and you'd give them back your reusable containers. The logistics on this would need to be handled carefully, as having a hub like a supermarket allows for less precision and preprocessing.

### Digital Light Novel

Digital technology allows for a whole new set of mediums to be available for consumption. Currently, they are all consumed in rather seperate and disticts formats that do not come together.

What if they were? Imagine a light novels that used gifs? Maybe you flip the page and it's a little movie clip. Or maybe a section of the book devoted to combat (which is rapidly paced and generally bogged down by reading pace) is made into a more comic strip?

What if this was done in a VR or AR type landscape? Where people could interact with a story in a whole new format? Maybe there could be sections of a story where you participate in a fight, or view a video in first person.

Using different forms of representation to the reader. Some typical things:
Think light novel, in a way

    - just pictures/ drawings accompanying descriptions
    - action sequences to be supplemented with clips, or maybe comic book style
    - heavy dialogue can be formatted differently, such that natural conversational styles can be highlighted, such as people talking over each other

Maybe, one way to think about it is this:
books are normally single threaded in concept. They are one series of data being processed continuously. Maybe there is room for more threads, to give different frames of perspective. 

If digital, 3D models for areas, people, etc.

There should definitely be focus on the writing, though. Otherwise, you might as
well be making a video game.

### Story Board Program

An app that helps filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, and anyone who might be able to take advantage of the information to be able to see and develop a storyboard digitally, interactively, efficiency, and with standardization. 

Its meant to both for creation and information digestion. If power point exists
with many slides and the ability to replicate, animate, and chain different
slides, a storyboard app can be an easy extension of that. This can also
advantageously include easily linked and integrated shotlists with easily
switchable information presentation formats; Ie shotlist to storyboard to
floorplan quickly and easily.

### Story App

    - Create or register events that can be time and location tagged. People can them post to the event with different media bites. People can then view those posts.

Posts can be set to private or public or friends, and the people viewing will.be able to only view it correspondingly

    - events can be Made by restaurantes or venues, where people can post to those things. People could also post to their own events that is related (or even coincidentally close) to such venue events IN TANDEM, so to both. 

    - remember stichbook app, where a picture could hold mutiple media to represent a event, like a picture album. Maybe these events could consist of these albums with the smaller, in tandem events becoming a part of that picture. Ie, picture of restaurant Saturday night, you see yourself in it and post a video of yourself eating. Someone can look at this event, see you there with that medium, and enjoy the experience via your post.

    - build your profile and repitoir of where you've been. Get points for doing stuff and going to events.

    - calendar event, links you to events that are like ours.

### Kamo

**Look at old compressed files in shoebox for photos and notes and all else**

    - Circular gesture to spin wheel
    - we've been looking at social media and trying to make it that. Its time to look at GAME examples
  Bejewled
  Pokemon go

    - quests! Play games taken with photos from around the world.

    - people post pictures. People can place prices on unlocking them. The price is in tokens, not real money. People get tokens by playing games OR watching adds OR in game purchases. 

Photographers post exclusive pictures
Artists post exclusive pictures

    - more advanced image/video editing mobile software. Give powerful artistic tools with high  customizability for the user. Intuitive. Also, then, if possible, make it interactive. Ex: give people a coloring book outline or your photo, and they fill it in with a bunch of different colors or their own. They can save their photo and other can see what everyone else did with it. 

    - photo mixer/stitcher. Does it for you, adding elements and creating a new picture.

    - data represented in a photo. Kind of colors you like, how much time you spend on a type of photo

-kamo locations can be used to activate a hidden picture or puzzle

-streaks for using diferent parte of they app/interacting with people

### Pocket

Pants for girls with pockets, also pockets you can add to pants.

So it's well known that girls don't have pockets for their pants, and would probably love them if they had were pretty sweet.

They can be in many forms. At patches. Can be sewn on. Can be installed more contretely. Hooked like a flap on the pants. Maybe a its 1 kit that you can buy for each Pocket that lets you be able to install it the way you want. Maybe there is a service that does it for you.

Different strengths and regidities for different kinds of pants, like denim vs cotton.

Different colors , styles, and functionalities. One more stretchy, maybe that's cool to sew onto running spandex to carry stuff. One more ridged to put on walking pants. One that is a blend, to be able to put on tight fitting long pants. One with a zipper.

It would be cool to analyse different pant usages, different environments, different styles, and then create matching and enhancing pockets for each situation.

Modularity is always good, so you can mix and match different properties of
pockets for different preferences.

### Magic Leap Applications

Take all conventional platforms and explore the analogue equivalent in MR. This might mean thikng of solutions to the same problems from the ground up, as the platform is completely new, or adapting the shortcommings of current tech to qield all the power that the MR allows.

For example, MFC girls run their shows. What if you combined the motion tracking
in Unreal, as demoed with the alien, and combine that with a sprite in Magic
Leap. Magic leap connects with unreal, so the sprite control can be done with
the unreal tracking the the placement and rendering can be done with magic leap.

### Gaming Company

    - Development
    - Arcade/ barcade
    - esports arena and team
    - tabletop store
    - LAN cafe
    - Tournament hardware catering

### Coffee Shop Chain

-Personalized, both to the person and the local area
-each different location has its own "thing": style, roast, brew, venue use.
-personalozed coffee brews. A person submits reviews of their coffee which the results can later be used to refine the brewing for later cups.

There is also the potential for a highly automated coffee shop that brew incredibly consistently and also possibly personalized for every cup. If the specifics of coffee brewing are basically operating brewing machines and timing stuff the human intuition and practice, there there is  lots of room for automization and precision.
        This can manifest itself the same way that there are vending machines that serve coffee in Europe

-Look up how these work and the variety they provide. If they do not allow for a high level of customization and specificity, then there is much that can be done with this. Also, remember Internet of Things. It may be possible to connect machines to the net and be able to make orders on the way to a machine so you don't need to order and wait. You could instead have it brew on the way there and pull it out of a compartment specifically storing your coffee and be on your way without waiting at all.
-Also remember crypto currency and the possible ability to get discounted coffee/ cryto reimbursement for allowing the coffee machines to be able to take your data.

### Synthetic Gems

-Creating synthetic gems for cheap, but intricate designs
-wrapping gems in layers around each other, or  layer them side by side, for
multicolor gems

### Vending Machines

They seem like good investments for their returns, if placed correctly. They
also scale.

The main idea that I had was having the vending machines be usable with crypto
currency and also be mining and verification machines.

### Smart House

Smartify everything. Not just conventional appliances; put sensors everywhere to be able to detect habits and optimize performance of all appliances.

Make the house learn about the kinds of things that you do and help you out with accomplishing them. Also, have the house be able to help you in accomplishing the things that you want to do.

Windows - how much heat escapes/ amount of daylight that goes through them. Maybe they are dim-able on command
Insulation - see how much heat escapes or enters
Water intake - water quality and usage
Toilet - Analyze excrement for biological information
Refrigerator - dieting and eating habits. When the fridge is open and closed
Tv - how much time is spent watching TV
Bath scale - track weight over the days
Bed - sleeping habits
Shower - Water usage and timing habits. Heat up water when getting up out of bed if you normally take showers after waking up. Maybe the house is linked with your phone so it knows when you go to work out and when you come back from that, so then heat up the shower accordingly. It can also analyze the ingredients in the wash solutions you use.
Dish washer - left over food analysis

Smart kitchen - Helps you cook by walking you through the instructions of a recipe. Heating up the oven for you accordingly and helping you not burn the dish too.

### Tech Platforms

The basis for making money is money exchange, that much is obvious. In order for there to be money exchange, there needs to be interactions between two humans.

If you think about it hard enough, every interaction between two humans could be monetized, if you'd like.

Not only that, but you can also monetize not just the interaction between two humans, but also the interaction between a human and some sort of product of another human, be it art, intel, hard goods, or whatever. Either way, where there is the necessity for a product, you can monetize this.

In terms of the discussion platform, there are many places that this can be applied. The product that this platform creates is intelligent conversation, which is one that I believe is sorely needed in this day in age and is also being salivated for. Simulating and creating a platform that facilitates and stokes this kind of environment is just one side of the coin. That must be analysed with a different lens and engineered properly. Monetizing it, then, would most likely involved finding the key mechanisms of this platform that create human interaction and entice those people to use money towards the goal of intelligent conversation.

This can be broken down further into smaller parts, such as the platform providing a learning experience through a seminar, not necessarily it being one conversation with another person being monetized, or even the ability to read full articles of news (as many new sites are putting themselves behind a paywall).

Some small examples could be, an article is sited to be discussed and a discussion ensues. The articles is from the New York Times. We can than facilitate selling articles of the New York Times by the article. Or we can have people link their New York Times account with our account and then be able to read the whole article of the citation that is being discussed on the website. Maybe, even, the people who created the discussion have a prerequisite of having read and access to the article in order to be able to join the conversation and say your part. The people are discussing the article, and we can monetize that.

Now, there is of course the question of how much people are willing to pay for XYZ type thing, and if a full subscription to all of NYT is necessary for one article, etc. This, I believe, needs to be analysed to strike a balance between many monetizing schemes that are less commitment than other thing or the other. By this, I mean there could be a gap in what someone is willing to spend and what is required to be spent. Bridging this gap is very important. What I am talking about is like a form of graduated payment types, to allow people to engage as much as they'd possibly like and remove as many restrictions as possible. We aim to give as many people as many options to have access to our website as possible, even if it requires payment.

One idea is advertisements. Advertisements are a way to be able to bridge this gap on a micro managed scale. If a person allows the page to show advertisements, then the advertisements should be able to pay back the cost of showing the individual that one single article on that one page that one time. Pricing would then need to be adjusted accordingly for that.

Also, advertising at a medium itself can be explored and tailored to be a new
kind of experience that takes full advantage of modern design techniques.

### Surveys for Cash

Offer people to answer surveys for crypto or straight money

INTEREST SURVEYS - Gauge information for something/ before something

First option:
Offer a certain amount of money for filing out a survey at random. Companies budgets x amount, $10000, for the survey answers. They say 100 people will get $100 from that survey at random. Tons of people will fill it out, more than 100 hopefully, and the company will get the survey. The problem is not being able to guarantee how many surveys are gonna be answered

Second option: First come, first serve
Companies budget an amount for surveys. The first x people to answer the surveys get the money split. The rest don't.

REFLECTION SURVEYS - Get information after something happens

### Goal Setting App

Has relation and may be a sub program in calendar app

this system should allow people to set up tasks and goals and:
-entice them to complete the tasks
-keep track of succes rates (ask is something succeeded)
-suggest ways to improve success?
-if you fail, or don't attempt, have the person ask why and have them try again maybe break down stuff more
-have the app be smart as to suggest task completion diffuculty
-have the app ask you to break something down into it's smallest components to try and make starting and completing something easier.

Some tasks tend to have other strings attached to them. Think about Chloe's client that has a problem with minibar snacks. Everytime Chloe books a hotel.she needs to make sure that the snacks are not interested the room. She needs to remember this manually. Therefore, maybe there could be a way to help her remember by allowing Chloe to build a template of Booking a Hotel for X client, where you build a set of repeated tasks to accomplish one larger one. That way, you can be extra efficient with work planning. Maybe, you could have nested as well as specialized templates, so that booking a hotel is one template, and later you nest it into booking a hotel for a specific person and have extra tasks attached to it. In this case, it could be the snacks, but it could also extend in general to, say, booking a hotel for clients so it's important to remember to use company cards and such.

This app could maybe even extend further as a tool for deligators. Someone in charge of a team could set up a genearl schedule of tasks to get done, and subordinates could then be assigned those tasks. The subordinates could then fill out details of those tasks more specifically and execute. The delegator does not need to know the details of completing the task as long as it gets done, and the subordinates may not need to know what the full plan from above is, either. Then, with the data of the team integrated, whenever the delagator assigns similar tasks, automatic proceedures can be subgenerated based on what the solutions that the subordinates came up with previously. The supervisor could also have the permission to go in and see what the subordinate came up with as a solution, and maybe even edit it as needed, to improve efficiency or something into the future.

### Calendar App

Make app task based, note time based

Useful to help people get stuff done incorporate modern science to maximize efficiency of different activity, this could be both theory by studies and data drawn from an individual

The app would give you the ability to set up tasks, routines, and variably complex schedules within each other and organize your day for you to be able to get stuff done maximally.

This can be organized in many ways, displayed in many ways like chronologically and nailed to times like classic calendar apps, or could be done with floating bubbles and display their relation to another.

Objects that could be set could range from one off's, to anchored routines, to variable routines such as workout regimens that are all "excersize" but the time period changes from the day to day. Each of these singular events may also be modularized further to be able to vary the details of their sections, but be abstractable to in realtion to other events. For example:

someone's day might generally consist of morning, work, and night. That is the classic dynamic (though maybe this app will allow for flexibility even in those if cross correlation of calendars can be used to allow generally fixed events, such as work time, to be flexible). The morning could then consist of many things, such as eating, showering, and meditation. But maybe someone does more than just that everyday (and in fact this app may help them be able to do different things in their routine without getting lost in the chaos of exploring it). Maybe someone who meditates wants to begin to do yoga or more heavy fitness, but can't find the time. If decided, they can change their meditation section for a modular section of "health" and have, maybe over a course of a week or month, different things scheduled such as yoga and fitness. Even inside of something like fitness, you could have different subroutines in there. All that would be for something like pre-work routine.

Then you have something like "work", where work itself could consist of meetings and different tasks you might have to complete. Work, for example, might be something that exists with hard bounds and requires to be workout around, or maybe you work for a company with more relaxed attendance times as long as you make your meetings and get your work done. Work itself can than be organized as well, further into scheduled events and flexible times that allow you to get your work done. The app should also, as mentioned above, use modern science to optomize your work efficiency. For example, changing tasks theoretically takes 15 minutes to fully adjust and refocus to an efficient workflow, so the app should take that into account and try and schedule different work tasks with 15 minute buffers.

### Live Stream Skill Classes

- Classes online, like yoga, cooking, etc
- Use machine learning to correct the people;s form with image recognition and matching
- Maybe kind of like Skillshare but leverage livestreaming for real-time instruction

A sight that will allow people to stream and is geared towards everything

The thing that will make is successful in certain realms, especially the women demographic, is to have it as a utility. Instead of entertainment specifically, it should also be designed to be friendly for for things like news, classes, etc, that are considered to be more serious subjects and therefore require a different standard of decorum.

Podcasts streamed aren't really done. If people upload videos, it's generally to Youtube. If streams, usually Twitch. These platforms are pretty good, but they follow a sort of similar pattern that subscriber/ follow based. This could be cool, but the browse section on Twitch for watching a specific game seems to be like the best way people find out about stuff they like to watch. 

A streaming sight that is topic specific might be worthwhile to look into. It would definitely help/ be necessary to have the experience personalizable. Considerations need to be made about the exntent of someone's ability to do that as well as the mechanisms to be used to do that. Newfeeds are ew, but sub boxes can be cool.

### Tutoring App

Getting people together to do tutoring on a craigslist/airbnb/uber type platform. Search for a service and find it and a person who is offering it.

### Decentralized Service Finding App

So this app can be a platform developed by us. It will give more power to the user and venues/service providers to be able to use this app in their own kind of built ecosystem. The gold here, for us, is a way to be able to capitalize on the fact that these new sets of ecosystems exist AND the fact that we are the ones that make the app. Transparency will be key, but we will also have the advantage of being the first to know what's up in the advances of the app's technology.

This app will work in a number of ways. It is meant to provide the service of recommending new cool things to do by criteria given from the user. Criteria should be highly abstracted and can range from direct tokens of information, such as specific places, ranges of distance, genres of music, blah blah blah, but can also be affected by a set of compiled dynamic information that would then be analyzed to see what might be great NEW things for someone to experience. How the probabilistic calculations are made with this is should be explored.

When someone uses the app to find a service, they will connect to a number of things and be given information from a number of places. If they are getting pure first suggestions, this could possibly come from us (as the fact that we could represent a more central server and be a bigger node in the distributed cluster.) but they could also come local places that are running our app. One of the things that our central server could do is keep track of what places use our software and help let those places know who to relay information from. This is more distributed and helps with keeping the data separated.

### Animation Studio Utilizing Advanced AI

[Two minute papers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)

This channel above specialized in papers that use AI to extend animation and simulation. The yields are incredible and can be used to develop media that have never yet been attempted because they manual overhead for achieving the same results would be way to high. AI applied here can scale to scenes of enormous magnitude to still yield engaging and accurate results.
