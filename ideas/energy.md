### Mor efficient energy storage for potensial energy based stores from kinetic energy sources

There is a concept of potensial energy stores such as water pumped up a hill or heavy object suspended very high. These systems are used as a more stable way of storing energy that does not need batteries, which are prone to degrading. Normally, these systems use excess energy from the grid in order to charge themselves, but this takes in all the inefficiencies of converting power into electricity first. For some cases, this is inevitable, such as solar power or coal plants, where the systems need to convert photons into electricity or combustion into electricity inorder to convert it into kinetic and then potensial energy. But, in the case of wind energy, it may be plausible to directly hook turbines to the systems that rotate pullies or pumps to move heavy objects or water. This would circumvent to the excess electricity going into the grid. You could have a was to engage the pump or pully onto the wind turbine dynamically (maybe like a car clutch).
