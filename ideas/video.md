### Fact-first Topic Discussion

Most content today that talks about IRL events do not have good facts presented up front. It's also become common practice to straight up lie. The honor that is implicitly attributed to any kind of news as protectors of truth is a lie. So, this opens up the interesting possibility of actually creating a new kind of media that adheres for being truthful.

[This video][actix-web-controversy-review] talks about a particular controversy that hit the Rust community about the open source crate Actix Web. The controversy was about the maintainer not accepting pull requests with enough reason to satisfy many people. The details of this are described in the video. What should be noted, though, is not the details of the video, but the way the presenter of the video when through what happened by showing everything that happened methodically. At the end of the video, it didn't exactly seem like the presenter had pushed a particular opinion about the event and I felt that I had constructed my own opinion on the matter.

This is a fantastic way to present news because it allows for a person to form a their an opinion on the presented facts without particular spin from the presenter.

It should be noted that omission can create spin inherently, even if done accidentally by not doing enough research. This precautions should definitely be taken in order to avoid this. This might be the biggest issue that needs to be dealt with, though, which is good because it can be countered with hard work.
