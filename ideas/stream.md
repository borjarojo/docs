### Themes

#### Pain

People like to watch others struggle, and yearn to see the relief. Some people want to see someone else in pain, while others would like to see someone succeed against it. Good content that is painful should not just be purely masochistic, because that tends to lack meaning behind the pain, so a goal behind the struggle to end it should always be considered necessary. 
  
#### Reoccurring

Content that can create habitual consistency captures people who might like to have something to consistently look forward to. Finding a content that is short and easy to consume, maybe with a sense of possible irregularity, could be comfortable and get people to consistently watch.
  
This may possibly one of the most important categories in streaming right now. Streaming in general succeeds more if you are consistent in your stream times, so people can know what to expect.

#### Indefinite

Content that has the ability to go on for an indefinite period of time can draw an audience on the anticipation for it's ending. This should not be confused with something that is perpetual, as in without ending.
  
Indefinite content can be made by setting a condition that must be reached which does not have a guided pacing to reaching that ending. Theoretically, a game has an indefinite play length, but it is really predetermined against playing the game through so this is not a good example. A good example of this is playing a competitive game until a certain amount of wins is achieved.
  
Sudo-indefinite content can sprout from trying to do something that is very difficult, too. If fact, this kind of dynamic is incredibly enticing because of a special cognitive dissonance that can occur. This is caused by the expected result of being able to complete something rather straight-forward against the constant failure that undermines that.
  
#### Tangential

This is weaker of a theme than many of the others because it is one that is directly related to another piece of content. That means that it would most likely only be effective in context/conjunction of another piece of content. That being said, this could be an attribute that would allow otherwise bad content be better or useful.
  
For example, I thought it would be cool to build a GBA custom on stream after completing a GBA game. Normally, that kind of content wouldn't exactly hold up on it's own, especially for a full steam. But, because it would be right after a game is finished, then it might be cool to make a custom themed GBA for that game. It would be content that would only work tangentially, but because it's different content, that could make it worth.
  
Something to also thing about with this theme is that many different kinds of content relate, so thinking about content relating and being tangential can allow for good segways in general, not just make normally bad content decent.
  
For this theme, the strategy of coming up with new content that is tangential or coming up with why some already thought of content is tangential are two good strategies for increasing value of content in both cases.

#### Multiplayer

Multiplayer games have a couple of different dynamics to them in terms of how they can build content.

The first is a creator to world relationship, that can display the way a creator is a person to others. This shows character, and can be used to help drive an idea of that.

Another dynamic is creator to consumer. If you play games with your consumers, you can build a relationship with individuals and tighten a bond. 

#### Crowd Sourced

Content that is picked and provided by the consumer allows for a number of interesting outcomes and dynamics.

Firstly, it can be more accurately relevant to the audience than what you can come up with yourself. It can help give you perspective on what kind of stuff a person is interested in consuming.

But, because of the full picture of what crowd sourcing content means, it's specifically people choosing for you to execute something. This means that it can easily be tailored to you, specifically, to consume. So, secondly, you can get more content that might be outlandish or not usually personally come up with because the consumers might have a crazier idea of how to evolve your stream than you. They are the ones that watch your stream, not you, so their perspective is different than yours.

Thirdly, this kind of content is bounded by what your consumers come up with. This usually amounts to high correlations with fringe ideas if the consumer base is a wacky. This can let you gauge their tastes.

Fourthly, getting the community involved is always good, and this is partially important because of that

#### Community driven content

Any content that is community driven can create a tighter bond between the consumer and the creator. There are different dynamics to this, though, that might alter just how much of bond is made.

There is a direct trade-off with bond amount creation with how much influence a consumer has on content. If the influence is little, then the bond created is also little, and large if the influence is large. The interesting thing about this then is how influence scales across consumer count. It wouldn't be feasible to have 1000 consumers highly influence content. I wouldn't really even how that looks like, to be honest. So maybe you can retain particular viewership of a person by allowing them to completely drive the content you create, but that wouldn't create a bond with other people at all, and may even alienate them. Or, you could try and figure out methods to drive content in a more distributed manner.

For the first extreme, of one person deciding content without any kind of say from the rest of the viewers, this could be done by literally just randomly choosing someone and telling them choose. This is no input from anyone as to how that person gets chosen and all input of driven content by only one person.

Voting for content is on the other extreme. Everyone puts something in and has influence, but little influence against everyone else. Being that this kind of dynamic has less impact, it would need to be done rather often to gain a significant kind of bond creation. Therefore, it would be worth exploring ways to construct voting opportunities, or other ways for all viewers to drive content, as often as possible.

Then, there could be gradients to that.

For example, a tournament of some kind could be held where the winner gets to decide on what the next kind of content to be done is. This gives viewers a chance to decide their own fate, in a way. This can also be semi tangential content as the tournament relates to the following content. A Pokemon Showdown tournament to decide a Pokemon game to play would be fantastic in terms of warming the viewers to Pokemon, new content that might not usually be viable (tangential), and get someone to be more committed.

Everyone evolved who decide to be in the raffle participates, which is a pool that can be pruned depending on how you enter the raffle. Criteria to enter can be changed as wanted, which is interesting in itself. Winner gets something.

Something to note, also, about the tournaments and raffle, and maybe some other hierarchical-in-nature ideas, is that they could possibly have multiple winners as well, depending on the selection criteria used. A tournament could be top 32 get something. A raffle could be draw 5. Like stated before, though, the bonding amount created for choosing content would be low if you don't get to actually choose the content, so content decisions might be best done for situations where many people can influence a decision, or a predefined set of choices if given and a single person chooses. In the first case, each person's opinion matters. In the second, it's more of a preference.

**Explore Gradients**: Figure out other ways that this can be done.

### Misc

#### Download streams

Basically just talking while watching a something download as the focus content.

#### Literal Contraries

Taking something that is advertised to be something and checking to see if it is actually the case.

#### Boomer-humor emulation

I was thinking something cringy like making a music video that replaces words in a pop song.

#### Fake News for Fiction Topic

Something like, "Thanos isn't dead" and then go through some bullshit reasons/evidence that he didn't actually die. It could be as silly as, "Even though they killed him, he came back to life, so he must be immortal."

Another way to phrase this kind of headline would be as a conspiracy theory. "Is Thanos really dead?" and provide enough bullshit that it works.

### Segments

#### You Snooze, You Lose!

It's an all-nighter type challenge where you stay up as long as you can with some other people, and the last one who stay up wins. You can make it interesting in some ways, maybe.

	- The person who stays up longest gets paid a dollar for every minute they are awake by the other two people.
	- If it's a charity stream, then you can match for donos. You could also force the people who fell asleep first to pay more to charity themselves, i.e. a dollar for every minute they were asleep while the winner stayed awake.
