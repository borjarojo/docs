### Storyline

King Boonis has been poisoned by having been served French Onion Soup. No one knows, but the culprit responsible is his son, Prince. His full name is Prince Prince Boonis the 1st.

### Events

#### The Great Redleaf Tree

- Needing to sacrifice a companion that you've raised and gotten to know in order to pass further. Maybe required, maybe partially required as a prequisite to something else, maybe used as a gate into something else.

The Great Redleaf Tree stands at the end of the forest taller and grander than all the others. The forest gets increadibly windy by the time you reach the tree. Its leaves are distrinctly crismson. Here, those that sacrifice a loved one may be granted the Talisman of Blood, increasing your health by a percentage, but denying you the ability to have a companion. The companion that is sacrificed in order to acheive this must meet certain weighty requirements, such as having fought and one a boss battle with you. The sacrifice must feel impactful for those who care for their companion, or otherwise distictly cold to those who want the talisman. This should be a choice made by the player, not one that is forced upon them. Maybe, this could be a side event of a more main storyline in the forest. The reward here is a trade-off, not a raw power increase.

On approach:
"The wind seems to have died down."

On the tablet that stands before it:

"Listen to the forest trees
As they gossip about the wind
Together they sway

Listen to the Great Redleaf Tree
Silent, and strong
Alone it stands"

Then, it should prompt you to sacrifice.

### Gamemode

#### Story

RPG-ish like, maybe megaman like. I'm not sure.

#### Wando Wackdown

Endless waves of wandos need to be dealt with. Starting small, they increase in numbers. Maybe, different levels unlock different collectables once you reach them. Maybe clearing levels unlocks rewards. Maybe the rewards are random from a set, allowing it to be a bit of a grind sync.
