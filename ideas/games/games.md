### Non-linear Skill Learning "System"

In most games, a lot skill learning is laid out for you. It tends to be oriented by class, or by level, a conjunction of the two sometimes, and resembling at it's core a tree/graph-like progression.

This is fine in many ways, but I think that it's a skeleton/prototype of what could be possible.

My inspiration for this idea comes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfSg2CFOWNU&t=617s). That's also not to say that hard magic systems don't have their own uniquely useful properties, but soft magic systems do, too, and are not very prevalent at all in video games. I think this makes sense as it would be easier to design a hard magic system under the constraints of programming. After all, a game would only have as much magic as you put in it.

Though, naturally, a fantasy has as much magic as you put in it as well. The difference, though, is that a well executed soft magic system doesn't necessarily have an understandable base from which the magic logically manifests. It difficult to fake a lack of explanation when an explanation (i.e. working code) is required in order for the magic to exist at all.

My idea is to, in a way, hide the magic system, and let the adventurer discover the magic themselves.

For a quick example, I'm imagining defeating a necromancer in their domain. Say this necromancer is not just a user, but a researcher as well. They might have tombs containing information about necromancy as well. From those tombs, you could learn the necrotic arts. And these skills could very, and need not be exactly concretely detailed. The system could allow them to be triggered in ways and in times that are not exactly predictable by the player.

I mentioned that the boss was a researcher. Maybe this system requires research to be done to unlock skills by following clues in a story and trying different things. Maybe a subsystem of experimentation would need to be developed to facilitate this. It could even be cool to have people research skills such that a skill can have many different ways to be activated and manifest differently, so that if a particular set of properties wants to be achieved than research would need to be done to get there.

This research idea even feels a little bit like a hard magic system, but I think that the implicit unknown gives it the feel of a soft magic system.

### In-Game Routines

I personally find crafting, cooking, and the rest very tedious in games. They are mechanics that I think are pretty cool as an idea, and when thinking about gave developement, I find that I also gravitate toward creating crafting systems. I do so because I think that they are cool way to reward players by allowing them to gain advantage due to inginuity. It can be a pretty goood feeling to know that a tight spot was overcome due to previous preparation. That being said, I personally don't engage in crafting systems because they are too annoying to deal with engaging in over and over again. Especially in the situation where a game gives quick save points, or a specific section of the game is played over again, it's annoying to manually set up before engaging in game play.

In-game routines is the idea to allow for a player to define what kind of stuff they want to craft for an instance and to be able to do a full crafting set automatically. This way, a player doesn't need to go through the same steps as it took them in discovering what kit they want to craft as just crafting it over again a second time. This would allow a player to easily replay an area to their liking, or even insentivise them to come up with different strategies for an area by setting up differently.

### Fast Travel

In a game where there is a large amount of space, fast travel is a must. This can be done in a variety of ways, but basically they are all teleportation.

Basic fast travel can be done with a section in the menu that allows you to select from a map.
One way to do it is with a hub that can send you tons of places.

There is also the question of what is too much fast travel and what is too little. This depends on the layout and the mechanics of the game world itself. For example. A game that relies heavily on small areas in a larger one, like Paper Mario, and allows you to be able to hope to any entrance point makes the game feel arcardy. If you reduce that and make it so you can only warp to any level entrance point, then it feels less arcade-y and more like an assistive tool to not need to get yourself across repetitive over-world locations.

### Tutorial

Tutorials are an important subject as many games need them. They also have a tendency to be really bad.

The use of a tutorial is to teach a player about the game. This can be accomplished a couple ways. In the context of a game, it can be useful to teach how to play the game mechanically. It may also be useful to give information about the game mechanics themselves. The best tutorials are those that are able to facilitate this learning organically. A good example of this is the Breath of the Wild tutorial, which is the Great Plateau. 

Mechanics should be introduced by playing them through, not in a heads up type system. They should also be done in an organic fashion, in context to the rest of the environment. They should not be too isolated to what you might actually encounter. In fact, they should make sure to extend the teaching mechanics enough to that the building blocks of the use cases are covered. This should also be reinforced with the inability to move on without learning the desired task. A bad way to implement that is to run someone through a 'training sim' and not them pass until they gets a certain amount of 'perfect attempts'. Teaching and perfecting are two different things, and a new player shouldn't be expected to nail mechanics, especially in an isolated environment where it won't matter. Having a player figure out the bare minimum necessary, and also make sure that the bare minimum must be covered, is a better why to engage a player in a tutorial.

### Mob Rank System

In Borderlands 2, (and maybe 1, I'm not sure), the mobs sometimes spawn to have a power increase augmentation. This is shown to the player by a prepending adjective, such as Badass or Godly.

It would be cool if there was a system that took the idea of power augmentation, but didn't work in a singular one dimensional boost. Instead, there are multiple sets of adjectives where each set's adjectives indicate an augmentation to a certain stat, and each individual adjective in a set indicates the severity of that augmentation. These sets and severities also no necessarily a purely advantageous change to the mob. If a mob has a certain trait that determines its stamina, and it gets augmented to be able to have a higher top speed, using that top speed might drain more stamina. Same thing might go for agility, strength and power, etc.

Example:
Amount of variability path tracking: Confused, Insane, Psychotic
Amount of stamina: Breathless, Active, Marathon
Amount of strength: Toned, Ripped, Jacked

This would allow a mob to behave differently because their capabilities would be
augmented, which in code might manifest as the weights in an AI's decision tree
might change.

### Object Display

Different object with differnt interactibility glow different colors when targeted, or have that kind of outline

- climbable, swingable, destroyable, harvestable
- Find a way to mitigate the 3rd-person look around wall cheat. One idea might be darkening spots that a player in 1st person wouldn't be able to see. Think this- ray tracing is a technique to display a frame by rendering what would be iluminated to the camera's eye. In this way, it might be possible to figure out what things should be illumnated in the first person and then do a transform into the third person.
Maybe, then, you can have items in the game that allow you to create reflections and be able to see around corners.
Memory of a place may also be useful to have, then, because it doesn't really make sense to not have an idea of what is around you. By that, I mean that in first person, sure you can't see what is behind you, but you remember it. In first person, you always see what is in front of you and rememebr what is around you. The 3rd person rendering of first person should work similarly. The game should remeber/ tag what you've seen in your suroundings and render those along with the new updates of what you see in the first person.
That which is not been seen can either be dark or be in synthwave-esque mesh.
The memory could also be cool to be able to give you a hint of what might be behind something

### Movement Options

- different states for different options. Free run, sneak, combat
- fluid parkour type movement. sprinting, climbing, vaulting, swinging
- sneak movements, such as crouching, proning, and sidling
- Juking.  Rolling, spinning
- in combat, ability to lock onto Target and strafe in circles, as well as tangentially.

Many ways to avoid recognition. As an exercise, think of how humans perceive things, identify then, and differentiate them from surroundings. Then, give a player tools to exploit those habits and functions to make them less noticeable.

- A person in a crowd is harder to spot. Allow them to be able to join and engage in a conversation with others to make them less differentiate able.
- Camouflage in another obvious one.

## Genres

### Battle Royal

#### Looting Replacement

As it goes with many games and their mechanics, once a game is played for tons of hours, patterns in the game play is revealed. Certain parts of the patterns, usually the ones that come to be repetitive and without dynamic playability, are the ones that end of being boring after a while.

Parts of games that fall under this category is when isolated, there isn't a challenge presented. In BR Games, looting without pressure is a big one. If you land someone without others, you can loot without worrying. Of course, you always have the threat of not knowing about someone, but that threat is actually the only thing that would make something boring like looting interesting. Other than that, it's running around and picking stuff off the ground. As far as gameplay goes, it's pretty bad.

Something similar can be said when grinding wild Pokemon. It's repetitive and it isn't dangerous. Really, it's just boring.

As far as these two go, they both have utility that is good for the game. In fact, their utility is necessary. It makes more sense to think that the two systems were created to satisfy the needs of the game then to introduce interesting gameplay. Looting is required to generate a type of RNG for equipment as well as an atmosphere of starting from scratch. Wild Pokemon are useful to be able to grind EXP and capture them. If you can make a replacement system that eliminates the boring part, then at the end of the day, it will most likely be a better system overall. Some people might complain and say it takes from the feel of the game, and that may be true, but that really is most likely the nostalgia goggles and not actual comparison between the two games and how fun they are.

Other examples of this are World of Warcraft and their continuous simplification of their game. They had tons of tedious things in the game that were later replaced by simplified systems. Many many players believe that the simplification has negatively and completely transformed the game into something that is a farcry from it's original form. They do have some point there, but I will say that I really do not think that it is as bad as they think. The play mechanics of the game are basically all still there. The controls are the same. The mob targeting is the same. They replaced tedious stuff. LFG is stupid easy now. Some people don't like how removing the need to sit for hours to do a dungeon removed the sense of teamwork that it generated. They are not wrong about this. Changing the LFG system changed everything that it generated. It removed the teamwork feeling of intamcy. It removed the traveling and feeling of actually being in the raid in the context of the world. It did, without a doubt, emulate a pick-up type atmosphere that could only be accomplished contextually and momentarily. Each of the times you entered, it felt unique because it was unguarenteed that it was going to happen in the first place. Those are all the things that the old LFG created.

It also took forever. They sacrificed working hard for an opportunity so that you could play the mechanics of the game. But WoW is an RPG. Working hard for opportunities is the whole point. So the change in LFG got people annoyed. They feel like it changed the game, which it did, without a doubt.

So really, the things that needs to be considered when doing this kind of stuff are numerous. Do you want to change the feel of the game? What makes the feel of the game? How well is one system accomplishing this? How does it serve the game mechanics. Is there a way to improve this across the board?

For the battle royal looting, it needs to be addressed across the game. Beginning, midgame, and endgame looting are all different. Beginning looting is a scramble, or safe. The scramble might be something that people like about the game. It's a scramble because no one has anything, and guns are very strong, so the first to get a gun will usually win. Once the scramble is over, then it's a skirmish. Whoever is left is those with guns. so those people will first. Then, whoever wins the skirmish gets the loot and moves onto the midgame.

So, the initial scramble, to me, is something that gets old. As a game feel mechanic, it's pretty iconic. You can drop and get nothing and get wrecked, instantly. After a bunch of times of doing this, I would rather just roll through to a game where I got some decent loot. I know that I can get it myself in the scramble. It's possible, for sure, I've done it before many times (IE I've actually played the game). I don't care to prove myself at the beginning of every game. It's annoying. I would personally remove this part of the game and have everyone start with a submachine gun or something. Doing this, though, would also change other parts of the game (obviously). If there are sections of the game that are built specifically on top of the idea that no one starts with anything, than this kind of change would destabilize those mechanics. For example, if everyone knows that they will start with a submachine gun, then people's drop patterns will change. Maybe they will go straight to hot zones because they automatically have a real chance of survival, and so does everyone else. Or, people might develop another strategy. A guarantee for a guns might mean that it would now make sense to just go to a safe location and slowly make your way to destinations. If you get in a firefight, you have a chance of winning, and maybe that chance is now higher than trying to engage in a hot zone at the beginning of the game. The result is reduced firefights as people have less of an incentive to engage. At one point, it was safer to risk your life for a weapon than to just run away. Maybe now it's safer to just run away. This would also begin to nullify the need for looting, unless the guns you get from looting are magnitudes stronger than the ones you are given from spawn.

There would be ways to mitigate this. One would be to tune starting weapons. That would eliminate scramble, but put you right into skirmish. This is good as it skips scramble, if you are looking to do that. If you can tune the starting weapons enough that they are good for initial engagement, but nothing more, than you can keep the value of looting and still have people drop in important places. If looting is just a means to an end, meaning that it was done to try and 'organically' give people equips then it might be better to allow people to create a starting kit with a certain number of peoples, or randomly give a starting kit based on what you expect for each person to get in a round. This would eliminate the beginning lootings, and probably all looting. It would also eliminate the other stuff too. To remove scramble RNG, maybe the solution is to give everyone a piston with a couple of magazines worth of rounds.

Or, in a different kind of game without discrete objects, you can generate
points more fluidly and without RNG . Everyone starts with nothing, but engaging
in battle will allow for you to be able to gain improvements. That way, the
scramble is eliminated because people are automatically engaging without
worrying about looting. It also eliminates the need for looting specific
objects, but it doesn't eliminate the need to somehow become more powerful. The
looting aspect of Battle Royal games lends to people becoming stronger overtime
by overcoming foes with weapons and gear that they want. It's a pretty good
mechanic. Maybe there is a better way to do this though. Maybe you can have exp
or money and buy gear from a store as the game goes on and you get more
skills. Or maybe in a different kind of game, you can level up abilities or
something.


#### Map Shrinking

Instead of having a circle, which is the first contemporary form that's come out

Parts of the map should start falling off.

#### Dualing

This idea is inspired by the situtation of having two people left in a battle royal, though there is room to extend this beyond that.

It's simple enough. One person offers to duel another.

You can extend it by having it that the winner gets something and the loser loses something, or either both or one or the other.

Depending on how this mechanic is used in a game:
You can extend it further by having it such that a dual equalizes two players that were unbalanced in their context. The duel would offer a ground to test skill. Mirror match type mechanics would probably be the most obvious for this, though there might be a different way to achieve this.

In the context of the final two in a BR:
Somehow, one of the players or both are able to offer to duel for the win. Maybe this is done my line of sight, or automatically offered as soon as only two are alive. If the BR has powering up mechanics, where the last two people maybe have increased their power over the course of the game, then the duel could equalize them to the same power level. 

You could even have the option to do this and decline if you want. Though, if you are powerful and decide to duel, you might get rewarded extra for pulling yourself down to an equal balance. If you are down and offer the duel, then you might get less because you powered yourself up. The same goes for the reverse. If you are down and win, you should get more. If you are up and win, you would get less. But, there is also the flip that if you lose and are down, you would get even less because you lost, though if you duel and lose after having been down, maybe you would get even less because your got powered up. It should still be worth it, though, because the option to duel should give you more for winning after powering up than losing as an underdog.

### RPG

Take the classic RPG of Dungeons, Equipement collecting, collectable, materials stuff, etc. Then, apply that with the kind of structure laid out below.

The hero progresses through the story completing challenges that grant him both training and access to new mechanics.

These mechanics can then be used outside in the overworld to further the game, open up new areas, and the main line quest.

For overworld: HEAVY exploration and tons to do. Really, it should end of being rather expansive and be able to do a ton in it. It's really like post a game should allow for a ton of replayability.

Dungeons that open up new mechanics can include different equipment, places to farm specific materials. These dungeons in themselves could be different parts of a larger world, no need to be closed off, and be themed as such.

Main story revolves around teaching you the mechanics of the game. It takes you along the journey and main lore, give you access to the elements you can harness in the game. Effectively, a mega tutorial.

#### Dungeon Crawler

- procedurally generated game with high re playability. With a fresh game you start with nothing, and as you play and fail, you unlock new items you can then begin with on the next play through. Those items can be gained on an achievement basis or picking up drops/ looting chests or something in the rounds (maybe either it keeps inherently or there mst be some sort of save mechanic involved. The gaining loadout items with each playthrough is a bit of a rpg element of farming gear, but it's meant to be more dungeon crawler focused in that the grind should be taken out. (cuz i hate the rpg grind). There could be multiple different themed dungeons with different mechanics, each offer new gear to collect that can then be used outside of that dungeon in other ones.

ALL ABOUT THE GEAR
- Gear is the main mechanism for improvement of character itself (alongside your person skill improvement). There should then be an exhaustive ability to explore different gear. Tons of drops, tons of upgrade ability, tons of tuning, tons of crafting.
- Drops can be artifacts, reagents, and money. You can trade with the money. you can craft higher spec reagents with materials. You can craft special armors and weapons with specific artifacts
- It's important, though, to try and curb the farming. It should be easier to trade to get what you want then it is to farm stuff. one way to curb this is an auction or trade system that is really global, allowing an ecosystem/ economy of drops to be distributed around to anyone who wants specific things. 

### RTS

#### Fractal Based

Ships are made of factals, so calculations are easier (or something)

Because units are fractal based, there should therefore be a way to combine the units together and split them apart to make other more or less powerful units.

### Education

I personally suck at writing. It's actually horrible. This is directly due to the fact that I didn't take English seriously during my childhood. I think this has to do more with the way that I was taught then with the subject matter itself. I find now that I'm older, I explore language way more and find it way more engaging than I ever had when I was younger.  I don't believe this is due to my teachers themselves, but rather due to the curriculum that they are required to teach. They all had different styles of teaching which expect different things from me, all of which were pretty solid (upon reflection, I didn't think this way at the time). The issue for me was actually a matter of what was expected to be learned and the criteria that was used to measure this. In these kind of courses, each teacher is required to have the students about specific properties and lessons through a text. I did notice, though, that my teachers would try to have their students learn more skills tangentially that were not necessarily part of the core curriculum. I believe that this is the kind of material that my teachers were truly passionate about because they would need to plan their lessons and work accordingly to achieve both.

I'm pretty sure that the tangential lessons were probably more useful than the core lessons.

So with that in mind, I think that there are skills a student can learn in a way that is more agnostic to topic that are incredibly powerful. In fact, learning those skills and practicing them across many subject domains is what makes them useful in the first place. Promoting the application of critical thinking by honing a more general linguistic tool set is the crux of language study. It's what makes it useful.

I think that a proper environment for this kind of study can help facilitate this kind of learning better. I think that a game-ification of this kind of stuff could actually be really useful. A lot of games have historically focused on the way to most sustainably keep an audience engaged, though the methods of doing this do not necessarily require any other merit to be commercially successful. If you can keep the audience engaged, then you have a platform to work off of, even if the changes made to a game to make it more commercially viable disrupt engagement. It becomes a trade-off between money and fun to be able to gain the most money for the company. The fun aspect is just a mechanism for the product, just like any other product.  An educational game would not necessarily be the best if it is trying to maximize on its profit. But, naturally, if something is too expensive, even if it is top of the line, there might be a reasonable trade-off between cost and necessity. The cheapest good-enough product is what most people would look for in something utilitarian.  Education, in my opinion, can never be 'too much', but it can indeed be too little. I would therefore try and evaluate a lower bound of efficacy,then measure actual efficacy against cost.

Apart from the practically of making this commercially viable, there must be a focus on the practical skill sets that can be developed. For example, many skills can be developed though each might require a different technique to develop them. They each would probably even benefit from a difference in learning v.s. evaluating.  For example, reading comprehension, in my experience, was normally evaluated using multiple choice questions after reading a passage during standardized testing, but was consistently tested with reflective composition during homeworkassignments. I think that the homework assignments would then also mix inother skill sets at the same time, such as research and argument building, butreading comprehension is implicitly built in as it was required in order to correctly achieve the other skills.

This kind of game would most likely be less typical (drastically less) to what you might expect for most games. The idea of a game would come into play with designing a proper reward system and allowing for users to make their own decisions on what to do. This is important as a tool, as allowing someone to explore their own interests is motivating. If someone wants to create their own subject to explore, and do a project on it, then they will most likely be willing to execute. The constraints on this do not need to be very much at all. That being said, the education needs to arise from somewhere, and someone could just as easily waste their own time on a subject by not building skill sets.

Conventional teaching has some of this, but lacks other points. The key issue with my idea might be the actual evaluation of what a student produces. If they are able to write about anything that they want, then the teacher would only be able to evaluate accordingly. This doesn't scale well, as teacher would need to be a subject expert on everything in order to be able to catch anything that a student wishes to explore. This can be solved, though, in the same way that is already done conventionally. If a student wants to learn about something, then a teacher needs to be available to evaluate and correct them. That being said, it does not mean that one teacher or one specific set of teachers needs to belocked for a student. Normally, a class would be assigned to a teacher for theduration of a year or semester, and each student would be locked into that class. If a student had, instead, access to a large array of teachers that each specialize in a subject, then their exploratory breath would increase and retain the depth that each teacher normally holds. What could be cool, then, is for a teacher to then come up with assignments particular to their subject domain that help address topics and skill sets that a student is required to learn. Because general skill sets need to span across many topics, students could work towards mastering them while retaining freedom of interest.

This is a really powerful motivator. There could still, indeed, be requirements for particular topical knowledge, but the requirements may be allowed to be softened if general skill sets can still be achieved because learning particular skill sets may no longer be tied to a specific section of knowledge.
